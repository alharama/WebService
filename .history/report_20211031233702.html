    <header>My Web Service Report</header>

    <a href="https://github.com/alharama/WebService"> My Github repository</a>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The theme of my Web Service is a music record holder with several
        options to view the data
      </li>
      <li>
        The content of my Web Service sends and references data in a MySQL
        database using the credentials schema
      </li>
      <li>The web service uses an express based service</li>
      <li>
        I was having trouble getting the web service set up on the correct
        website with nginx
      </li>
      <li>The endpoints and parameters are properly named as listed below</li>
      <li>The webservice accepts complex json data</li>
      <li>
        The Webservice blocks all ports outside of the droplet if created in the
        droplet
      </li>
      <li>I had trouble creating the nginx server on the droplet</li>
      <li>
        My service is stored in a github repository and shared with the
        professor on slack
      </li>
      <li>My creation and schema scripts are included in my repository</li>
    </ol>

    How to use the web service
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right now the web service isn't working correctly on the droplet but
        works well on the local host if you would like to pull the repository
        files
      </li>
      <li>Operations include the following</li>
      <li>
        POST: '/:song': Takes a song with the artist and genre in the json body
        and adds it to the database
      </li>
      <li>
        !!!!SONGS ARE CASE SENSITIVE AND MUST USE UNDERSCORES FOR SPACES!!!!
      </li>
      <li>An example for All of the Lights by Kanye West:</li>
      <li>
        curl --request POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data
        '{"Kanye West":"Rap"}' http://localhost:8443/:All_Of_The_Lights
      </li>
      <li>Other functions include:</li>
      <li>
        GET '/songs' which returns a list of all song info in the database
      </li>
      <li>GET '/:song' returns the song information for the specified song</li>
